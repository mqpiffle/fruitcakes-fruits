# Fruitcakes full CRUD Full Stack App

- Use Express to build a server
- Use Mongoose to communicate with mongoDB
- Full CRUD functionality on our fruits resource
- User Authentication
- ability to add comments to fruits
- (maybe gather data from a 3rd party API)


This app will start as an API that receiver requests and sends JSON responses, but eventually we will add a views layer that will render HTML in a browser.
